# Migration Instructions: Replit → Lovable

## IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Your Financial Situation
- **Total Replit Costs:** $466.74+ (and counting)
- **Non-functional application** after significant investment
- **Platform lock-in** preventing easy migration

### Migration Steps to Lovable

#### Option 1: Direct GitHub Push (Manual)
Your code is ready at: `https://github.com/RajAbey68/kolake-escape-portal.git`

**If you have GitHub access:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository 
2. Copy this entire codebase manually via browser
3. Create new repository for Lovable import

#### Option 2: Download Archive (Recommended)
A complete export has been created: `ko-lake-villa-complete-export-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz`

**Steps:**
1. Download the archive file from your Replit
2. Extract contents locally 
3. Upload to new GitHub repository
4. Import GitHub repository into Lovable

### What's Included in Export
- ✅ Complete React/TypeScript application
- ✅ All source code (src/ folder)
- ✅ Playwright test suite (140+ tests)
- ✅ Configuration files (package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)
- ✅ Tailwind CSS styling
- ✅ Component library (shadcn/ui)
- ✅ Cost analysis documentation

### What's Excluded (Intentionally)
- ❌ node_modules (will be reinstalled)
- ❌ .git folder (avoid conflicts)
- ❌ dist/build folders (will be rebuilt)
- ❌ Large archive files and logs

## Key Issues to Report to Replit Support

### 1. Excessive Usage Charges
- Monthly credits: $25/$25 (100% used)
- Additional charges: $201.74
- Over budget by $26.74+
- **Total agent usage: $226.74+ for non-functional application**

### 2. Platform Lock-in Issues
- Cannot extract codebase via Git (operations blocked)
- Forced to use manual export methods
- Migration barriers preventing platform change

### 3. Failed Deliverable
- Application has critical failures (gallery, admin interface)
- Tests reveal systematic issues
- Weeks of development with no working product

## Next Steps
1. **Download your export archive NOW**
2. **Create new GitHub repository** 
3. **Import to Lovable platform**
4. **Contact Replit billing** for usage charge review
5. **Move development to Lovable** for reliable environment
